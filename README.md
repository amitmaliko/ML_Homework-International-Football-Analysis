# ML Homework - International Football Analysis

This project analyzes international football matches and uses machine learning techniques to predict match outcomes, cluster teams, handle missing data and analyze player performance.

## Files Included
- `data/goalscorers.csv`: Data on goalscorers.
- `data/results.csv`: Match results.
- `data/shootouts.csv`: Data on shootouts.
- `Assignment 2.pdf`: Assignment details.
- `ML_HW2.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook with the analysis.
- `Presentation.pdf`: Project presentation.

## Analysis Overview

### Data Exploration & Visualization
We explore the dataset to understand its structure and contents. Various visualizations help in understanding the distribution of data and identifying any patterns.

### Data Preprocessing
This step involves cleaning the data, handling missing values, and preparing the data for further analysis. Techniques such as imputations are used to handle missing data.

### Feature Engineering
We create new features that can help improve the performance of our models. This includes creating meaningful features from the existing data and transforming data where necessary.

### Model Training and Evaluation
We use various machine learning models to predict match outcomes and evaluate their performance. Models such as Decision Trees and Random Forests are used for classification and regression tasks.

### Clustering
Clustering techniques are applied to group similar teams together based on their performance metrics. This helps in identifying patterns and similarities between different teams.

### Dimensionality Reduction
Techniques such as PCA (Principal Component Analysis) are used to reduce the dimensionality of the data, making it easier to visualize and analyze.

### Player Performance Analysis
We analyze player performance data to identify top performers and understand their impact on the game.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn
